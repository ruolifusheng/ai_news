> Analyzed 33 items, but none met the importance threshold.

No significant developments today. This might indicate:
- A quiet day in your tracked sources
- The AI score threshold is too high
- Your information sources need expansion

1. Lowering the `ai_score_threshold` in config.json
2. Adding more diverse information sources
3. Checking if the AI model is working correctly
